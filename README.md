# Detection-of-Fish-Diseases-Using-ML
Coming to this project title is Detection of fish diseases in an aquaculture using machine learning techninques.
I have taken Data set on three Diseases which are Red Spot , White spot and MAS(Motaile Aronamus Septisemiya).
I trained using dataset to the model using Machine Learning Algorithm which is KNN Algorithm and after that I tested the Model using test data finally the macgine learning model will predict the disease of the fish.
